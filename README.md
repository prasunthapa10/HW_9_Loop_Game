# HW_9_Loop_Game 
# Addition Game 
# Introduction
We are going to customize our addition game code using the methods, loops and arrays. This helps to make our code
shorter and more effective.It consists of four rounds. The user is asked to add two random numbers. Each correct answer is followed by 10 points and incorrect answer is followed by simpler question. At last, the final score is printed on the console screen.

# Project Outline
```
//Call the addition game method.
// Assign the value for hardness, score and hardness setup.
// Set up my for loop to go through the number of rounds
// Use the arrays to sort the nmbers
//  Use the boolean data type to verify the answer
// Use the if statement to compare the answers and Print statement to print the result.
```

warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value has changed in
Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this message
and maintain the traditional behavior, use:

  git config --global push.default matching

To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

  git config --global push.default simple

When push.default is set to 'matching', git will push local branches
to the remote branches that already exist with the same name.

Since Git 2.0, Git defaults to the more conservative 'simple'
behavior, which only pushes the current branch to the corresponding
remote branch that 'git pull' uses to update the current branch.

See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.
(the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode
'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)

## Summary
In the print statement, the main method calls a greeting method in the print statement. The main method also calls the addition game method. The main method has no outut and input variables. Additiob game method has internal variable called gameVariables. From this source code we can easily figure out how the methods and arrays have made our life easier. We have also used the for loop that has helped to generate the same loop for four times. The pevious addition gam without loops and methods was too long, but now the code has become short and sweet. Instead of typing the same code for four rounds, we used the for loop. We use the public static void method and public static boolean method to make our code easier in the above program. We can use the same concept to find the otput of other programs in the upcoming days.
